    <h1>Learning about videos and audio</h1>
    <p>
      head to <a href="https://pexels.com">pexels</a> to download free videos
      and photos.
    </p>
    <video src="/videos/ocean.mp4" controls>
      your browser doesn't support videos.
    </video>
    <p>
      use control attribute to add control over video. it is a boolean
      attribute. so if you right its name, it will be available and if you don't
      it won't be.
    </p>
    <p>
      autoplay att will make the video play automaticly after the page is
      loaded.
    </p>
    <p>loop will loop videos</p>
    <p>
      why video elemnt is not a single element? because what should user see
      when the video is not loaded or the browser can't support the video?
      exactly the text you write for video element.
    </p>
    <p>audio is exactly like video.</p>
