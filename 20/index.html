    <p>
      if you want your box to take up all the space of the viewport, setting it
      to 100% won't work because the height of a page increases as we add
      content to it and at first it is 0.
    </p>
    <p>10em: 10 x font size of the current element</p>
    <p>10rem: 10 x font size of the root element, 16 * 10</p>
    <p>
      why to use em and rem? cause people can manually change the size of font
      in their browser and with increase in font size, the box will also
      increase.
